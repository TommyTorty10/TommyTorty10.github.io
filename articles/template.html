        <p align="right">The Maxitronix Shortwave Radio Kit is a simple receiver for two bands, 6-8 MHz and 12-18MHz.
            The kit comes with various wires that you use to connect the components onto the cardboard plastic box included.
            Each wire can be connected via springs on the board.  It is powered by a 9V battery, clip included, and uses
            a ceramic piezo buzzer as an earphone.  Part of the circuit was pre-assembled on a pcb.  Beyond that, there
            is very little.  The directions are cut and clear, but everything about the kit retains an intentional minimalism.

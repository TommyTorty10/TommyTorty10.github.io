        <p align="right">While prototyping another project on a breadboard, I realized, that a dedicated, variable, DC,
            supply would make working with the breadboard much easier.  I have larger, more powerful, variable, power
            supplies, but I wanted the convenience of a small one on my desk.

        <img src="../media/02-16-2020/low_voltage_power_supply/lit_display.png" title="LED Display">

        <p align="right">I used a cardboard box, that I had received items in the mail with (hence the blacking out of
            the address).  I salvaged the display from a broken power supply, and it is designed to read voltage, so I
            did not have to reinvent as much circuitry.  You can get a similar display on
            <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/705">Adafruit's website.</a>  It has three wires:  one for a
            positive DC voltage to power the display, one ground, and one to measure any DC voltage relative to the
            ground wire.

        <img src="../media/02-16-2020/low_voltage_power_supply/internals.jpg" title="The Circuit">

        <p align="right">Inside, the heart of the thing is a LM2596 DC-DC buck converter from ebay.  It can step down
            any DC voltage (within its rating of course), and can be adjusted via a screw on a variable resistor.  I
            intended to replace the board's variable resistor with a potentiometer for easier adjustment, but I had
            a multiple failures, which I'll discuss later.  On the input of the converter, I soldered a barrel jack as
            well as the positive and ground DC wires of the display (in parallel).  On the output I soldered two wires
            to a terminal strip, to which I soldered two, long breadboard jumpers.  That's it for electronics inside the
            box!  Finally, I hot-glued everything down, so as to prevent any shorts.

        <img src="../media/02-16-2020/low_voltage_power_supply/AC_inverter.jpg" title="Wall-Power">

        <p align="right">The barrel jack is for an old, radioshack-brand inverter set to 12 V.  During testing I set it
            to 6 V, because it was easily able to produce sparks at 12 V with it's 1,000 mA limit.

        <p align="right">On the backside of the project-box, I made sure to label, that the barrel jack is center
            negative.  In retrospect I should have made it center positive for greater safety, but it's done now.

        <img src="../media/02-16-2020/low_voltage_power_supply/2596_bottom_burnt.jpg" title="Failures">

        <p align="right">Now, onto what went wrong.  The LM2596 converters are very appealing, because they are very
            cheap, but the low price point means, that they are rather delicate.  I destroyed three of them trying to
            remove the built in variable resistor and attach my own potentiometer.  With only one converter left on
            hand, I decided to leave it be for now and to just use it's somewhat inconvenient, little screw.
            <br><br>
            What broke every time was the same solder pad disintegrated.  I adjusted my iron to its lowest usable
            setting, and I still made a mess of it.  I used flux and a medium temperature setting to work quickly, and
            it burnt up.

        <img src="../media/02-16-2020/low_voltage_power_supply/saved_board.jpg" title="Salvation">

        <p align="right">Frustrated and fatigued, I saved one of the boards by soldering the variable resistor back on
            upside down, however the connections are very poor, and I do not intend to improve them due to the
            old axiom "don't fix what's not broken," and this ugly, little thing can regulate voltage.

        <p align="right">I'll update this page, if I ever get the potentiometer soldered on, but for now I'll conclude
            by giving you the schematic of how it should be.
